# A simple one parameter model

In this example, random observations from a normal distribution with known variance are generated. The particle filter is used to perform Bayesian inference on the mean-parameter of this distribution. 

The estimates produced by the particle filter are compared against analytically calculated estimates.

Make sure you have ParticleFilter.jar in your classpath, and everything should be just fine. 

NOTE: each time a new random data set is generated.
